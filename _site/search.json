I became passionate about growing the R community, and founded #TidyTuesday to help newcomers and seasoned vets improve their Tidyverse skills.\nI work at RStudio on their Customer Success team, helping our customers be as successful as possible with RStudio software in their environment.\nIn my home town of Dallas, my wife and I run on the local trails, play with our Boston Terrier puppy “Howard”, spend lots of time with our five nephews and families, and are always on the lookout for great new food, especially churros.\nContact\nYou should probably just tweet me @thomas_mock.\nThanks\nIf my blog has helped you, you can buy me a coffee!\n\n\n\n",
