### Why `ggplot2`?

Per [John Burn Murdoch of the FT](https://johnburnmurdoch.github.io/slides/r-ggplot/#/35):

> `ggplot2` is awesome because:
> - It takes minimal time and effort to audition multiple different ideas for a graphic, and to iterate on them
> - It gets people thinking in the continuous visual encoding space, rather than the discrete chart-type space

### Breaking that down

* `ggplot2` (and R) is fantastic for exploratory data analysis  
* `ggplot2` is an application of the "Grammar of Graphics", rather than a "make this chart" tool

# Coding time!

## Data Prep

A few datasets to start us off

```{r, message=FALSE}
diff_df <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jthomasmock/radix_themockup/master/static/diff_df.csv")
combo_pass <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jthomasmock/radix_themockup/master/static/combo_pass.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(diff_df)
```

---

### Back to basics

```{r}
basic_plot <- ggplot(diff_df, aes(x = differential, y = win_percent)) +
  geom_point()

basic_plot
```

---

### Built in themes

```{r}
basic_plot + 
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### Built in themes

```{r}
basic_plot +
  theme_bw()
```

---

### `ggthemes` themes

```{r}
basic_plot +
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

---

### `ggthemes` themes

```{r}
basic_plot +
  ggthemes::theme_economist()
```

---

### Manual theme

```{r}
basic_plot +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "red"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 20, color = "red"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "blue")
  )
```

---

### `theme()` elements

For the theme elements, there are:  

* `element_line()` - change line element components, takes arguments like color, size, linetype (dotted, dashed, solid, etc)  

* `element_rect()` - change rectangular components like plot backgrounds, legend backgrounds, etc, takes arguments like fill, color, size  

* `element_text()` - change text components like axis labels, titles, and takes arguments like family (font family), face (bold, italics, etc), hjust/vjust (horizontal or vertical alignment), color, etc  

* `element_blank()` - completely remove an element by name  

* `margin()` - adjust margins of an element, can be used within some other theme componenets, and takes arguments of t (top), r (right), b (bottom), l (left), and unit (unit such as points, in, cm, etc)  

* `rel()` - relative sizing of elements, useful for text especially, ie choosing a base font size and scaling the titles vs body fonts relative to each other

### A personal favorite

I love FiveThirtyEight's graphics and tables, as such we'll try to recreate some of their graphics. We're going to "steal like an artist"

--

### Key elements

* Focus on Web, ie relatively small graphics  
* Light smoke-grey background with grey gridlines  
* Black Plot Titles/Subtitles and Axis Labels  
* Grey axis text (ie numbers on axis)  
* LARGE plot titles and axis labels, with medium subtitles and axis text  
* Opinionated fonts  
* Always add a source  
* Bright, high-contrast colors for plots

### Color by playoffs

```{r}

  mutate(
    color = case_when(
      season < 2020 & seed <= 6 ~ "blue",
      season == 2020 & seed <= 7 ~ "blue",
      TRUE ~  "red"

  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size = 0.75, color = "#737373") +

### Add text

```{r textPlot, eval = FALSE}

### Refine labels

First create a helper dataset, we'll use it for annotations later.

  label = c("Missed<br>Playoffs", "Made<br>Playoffs"),
  color = c("#D50A0A", "#013369")
)

nfl_stand_refine <- nfl_stand %>% 
  mutate(
    color = case_when(
      season < 2020 & seed <= 6 ~ "#013369",
      season == 2020 & seed <= 7 ~ "#013369",
      TRUE ~  "#D50A0A"

### Summary

* "Steal like an artist" for inspiration  

* Themes can make your customizations more consistent  

* Colors on top of that further extend the presentation  

* Annotations help tell a story
