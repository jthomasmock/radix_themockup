# Tom Mock

* Bachelor's degree from Southwestern University (where I thought I wanted to be a Physical Therapist).
* Master's degree from Florida Atlantic University (where I realized I actually really liked data and making graphs)
* Doctorate from UNT Health Science Center (where I realized I really didn't like biomedical science, but still really liked data, graphs, and now R)

## Current State

I fell in love with R and data science through my graduate research, using R and RStudio to wrangle, analyze, model, and visualize my data. I became passionate about growing the R community, and founded [`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) to help newcomers and seasoned vets improve their `Tidyverse` skills.

I work at RStudio on their Customer Success team, helping our customers be as successful as possible with RStudio software in their environment.

In my home town of Dallas, my wife and I run on the local trails, play with our Boston Terrier puppy “Howard”, spend lots of time with our five nephews and families, and are always on the lookout for great new food, especially churros.
